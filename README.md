# Scrape-Worten-Flask

This website was created as a way for me to practice using the Flask microframework.

The user enters a query, just like it would in https://www.worten.pt/, and then, through a Python script (/scrape_worten_products/scrape_products.py), information about the first result is scraped, an HTML template created and then rendered in the website.

For more information about the original Python project to scrape products from Worten, visit my GitHub repository https://github.com/Ze1598/Scrape-Worten. What is used here is an adaptation of what I call "catalog" in that repo.
